Python Code for Re-purposing Graphics Algorithms

### Part (A) of COMP120 Assignment 1: Tinkering Graphics - Contracts

We all worked on our own contracts, sharing just advice rather actually pair programming.

[Cyrus](https://github.com/ZeusOfTheCrows) will be taking ownership of Contract #1 - Dungeon Tile Generator.\
[Adrian](https://github.com/AdrianRodri) will be taking ownership of Contract #3 - Dungeon Entity Generator, unless he is unavailable or wishes to change contract.\
[Paul](https://github.com/Powll) will be taking ownership of Contract #4 - Dungeon Entity Reskinning.\
[Jakob](https://github.com/jc220866) will be taking ownership of Contract #5 - Colour Blindness UI Analysis Tool.\

### Algorithms and Functionality

The algorithms were distributed amongst the members, each of us implementing at least one into our contracts.
