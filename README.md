Part (A) of COMP120 Assignment 1: Tinkering Graphics - Contracts
We have chosen four contracts to split between the four of us, but this does not exclude one another from asking each other for assistance, teamwork is gold after all.

Paul will be undertaking Contract #4 - Dungeon Entity Reskinning.
Jakob will be undertaking Contract #5 - Colour Blindness UI Analysis Tool.
